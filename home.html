         <p class="lead p-1">The IfCA programme is a joint initiative between India and UK to pilot air quality improvement initiatives in Bengaluru. It was launched in May 2019. The first test bed under this program focussed on creating a Clean Air Street (CAS), i.e., promoting pedestrian-only streets with EV Innovators and Air Quality innovators participating. A testbed was developed with zero emission charging facility in the campus of IISc. Year two of the project saw the extension of this testbed to developing a modelling tool that can help Electric Supply companies determine appropriate charging location.

         This modelling tool is an effort by Catapult UK, IISc Bengaluru and Urban Morph Bengaluru to assist BESCOM in Bengaluru and other charge point providers discover ideal locations for provisioning electric vehicle charging stations. It takes into account Social, Behavioural factors and Grid characteristics to determine the locations. 

         The model takes into account the travel dairy of EV users, cost, wait time, charging time, emissions, m service range, accessibility, safety, supply side grid characteristics to arrive at the appropriate locations, the visualisation incorporates scenario analysis to allow for projections and alternative scenarios that may change the locations of these charging stations.</p>
